# CA05 â€“ Logistic Regression

Runtime: 1min

### Problem
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) kills more people than cancer globally. A dataset of real heart patients
collected from a 15 year heart study cohort is made available for this assignment. The dataset has 16
patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information.

### Solution
I used Logistic Regression model to predict the risk of CVD for patients based on the data.
